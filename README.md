# Create Some Notes

## Description

This is my Note Taker application. The code for the front-end of the application was already provided to me. I had to add the code for the back-end of the application. The backend of the Note Taker application is responsible for managing data storage, serving API endpoints for interacting with notes, and ensuring the application's smooth operation. It works in tandem with the front end to provide users with a seamless note-taking experience.

## Installation

In the terminal, you have to first type the command 'npm i'. This command installs all the necessary packages for this application. After all the packages have downloaded, you have to type the command 'node server.js'. If the server is running successfully, you will see a message in the terminal: "App listening at 'http://localhost:3001' ".
